Explanation of Key Metrics
Below are the primary settings you’ll tweak between conservative, moderate, and aggressive profiles.

rsi_period

The lookback period for computing the RSI (Relative Strength Index). Commonly 14.

rsi_overbought / rsi_oversold

RSI thresholds that define overbought/oversold conditions. A conservative strategy might treat the market 
as “overbought” at a lower RSI (e.g. 65) and “oversold” at a higher RSI (e.g. 40), resulting in fewer trades.

stop_loss_pct

If use_atr_stop is disabled, this is the percentage of your cost basis where you place a stop-loss (e.g. 0.98 means 2% below your cost basis).

use_atr_stop

If true, the stop is based on the stock’s volatility (ATR), rather than a fixed percentage.

atr_stop_multiplier

Determines how many ATRs below your cost basis the stop is placed. For example, if ATR is 1.0 and multiplier is 2.0, you place the stop 2.0 points below cost.

atr_multiplier

A separate ATR factor you can use for additional logic (e.g., partial TPs, averaging down, etc.). Some strategies use the same multiplier for 
stops and other calculations; others keep them separate.

take_profit_base

The multiple of your cost basis at which you start taking profit. For example, if 1.03, you aim to sell once price is 3% above cost.

take_profit_bump

Extra profit multiplier if the price makes a “fast move.” For instance, if take_profit_base = 1.03 and take_profit_bump = 0.05, 
then a rapid move might raise your profit target to 1.08 (8% above cost).

fast_move_threshold

The intraday % price jump that qualifies as a “fast move.” If the price moves more than this threshold in one bar (or some short timeframe), it triggers the bump.

macd_confirmation

If true, the bot checks MACD vs. MACD signal for bullish/bearish confirmation before buying or selling. Turned off here for simplicity.

risk_per_trade

The fraction of your total account balance you’re willing to risk on each trade. Conservative is lower (e.g. 0.03 or 3%); aggressive is higher (e.g. 0.15 or 15%).

min_risk_per_share

Ensures a minimum per-share risk used in your position sizing. Helps avoid unrealistically large share counts when ATR is very small.

max_shares_per_trade and max_position_value

Hard caps on how many shares or how many dollars’ worth of shares you can buy at once.

indicator_switches

Which technical indicators to use (RSI, MACD, SMA20, etc.). If false, the logic that references them is bypassed.

partial_tp_levels

Array of partial take-profit triggers. For example, if multiple_of_risk = 2.0, the bot might sell 50% of your position once the price has 
gained 2× your “risk per share.”

Each object has a sell_fraction so you can scale out in increments.

drawdown_protection

Daily drawdown limit stops trading if you lose more than a certain % in one day.

Total drawdown limit can do the same for total equity drawdown. (Here we only enable daily.)

enable_trailing_stop and trailing_multiplier

If trailing stops are enabled, the stop will move upward with the price once you’re in profit, using some multiple of ATR or a custom logic.

The trailing_multiplier sets how tight or loose that trailing stop is.

partial_take_profit and partial_take_profit_ratio

If partial_take_profit = true, the bot uses partial TPs.

partial_take_profit_ratio can help define how big the partial TPs are relative to your initial risk or cost basis.

position_size

A fixed base position size if you want to override or supplement the risk-based share calculations. 
Some strategies will just ignore this if they rely on risk_per_trade, but it can also be used as an additional limit or default trade size.
